Sure, I'd be happy to explain how to use HTMX with Genie.jl.

Genie.jl is a web framework for the Julia programming language, and HTMX is a client-side library that allows you to add AJAX-y features to your web applications without writing any JavaScript.

Here's how you can load HTMX in the HTML output of your Genie.jl application:

1. First, you'll need to include the HTMX library in your HTML file. You can do this by adding the following line in the `<head>` section of your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.8.4"></script>
```

2. Next, you can start using HTMX in your Genie.jl application. For example, you can add the `hx-get` attribute to an HTML element to make it trigger an AJAX request when clicked:

```html
<a href="/some-route" hx-get="/some-other-route">Click me</a>
```

When the user clicks on this link, Genie.jl will handle the request and return the response, which HTMX will then insert into the page without a full page refresh.

You can also use HTMX to update parts of the page in response to other events, such as form submissions or input changes. The HTMX documentation has a lot of examples and information on how to use the different features.

Overall, using HTMX with Genie.jl can be a great way to add dynamic and responsive features to your web applications without having to write a lot of JavaScript.

**Coding output**

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.8.4"></script>
```

```html
<a href="/some-route" hx-get="/some-other-route">Click me</a>
```

**IDEAS**
- Use HTMX to add AJAX-y features to Genie.jl apps
